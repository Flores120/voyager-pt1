          <h1> - The Voyager Process - </h1>
            <p>Getting the project started was hard enough. The roadblocks I faced to get the project up and running was tough. If you would ask me if I was satisfied with my project I would tell you no. Why? because when doing a project I always feel like I can do better. My project has room for improvement just like any other project. As for the idea for Voyager, I actually got the idea from an earlier project. The project had no name it was simply a project to learn Foundation. It has the same concept as Voyager but it was plainer and felt more like an actual website. This is where the idea of making the project look fun and nostalgic came. So I rolled with it and voila Voyager was created.

          <h1> - The Programming Journey - </h1>
          <img src="img/program-bg.jpg" alt="program">
          <p>The programming journey for me has been a fun ride, filled with its ups and downs. One of my biggest setbacks when starting to programming is all this information coming at me at once before I started epicodus I didn't know anything about programming, heck I didn't even know how to type properly which made it difficult for me to keep up with the lessons. Once I got the mere basics of programming, I felt more confident with myself to keep going. Then I started Javascript and it was hell learning that, I've built a love-hate relationship with Javascript. The hate part coming from all debugging and errors I got starting to learn this language and the love part coming from what I was able to create with it. This project doesn't have any Javascript in because I wanted to showcase my CSS skills, but most of my projects do have Javascript in them.</p>
